  <!-- the <img src="" alt="">  tag is a self-closing element because it doesn't require a closing tag to work
it does however require an attribute, which is a special tool that allows us to change the behavior of our elements.
For example the img tag rquires a src or source attribute in order to located the source of our image, the image can either be URL fetched from the internet
or it can be a local image thats included in the same directory as your website. When the browsers come across a url file it will ping the servers to optain this image,
once it gets permission. it will display it.  -->


  <!-- the <i></i> tag will make text italicized just for styling purposes
  or visually & it doesnt confer any of that emphasis informtion -->

  <!-- The <em></em> tells the broswer that the words in between should be
  streesed or emphasied
  and it conveys more information.
  its not only about style and a good developer will always use <em></em> -->

  <!-- When we're writing HTML code where more concerned about structuring our
  text rather than caring about how it looks or how it appears . -->

  <!-- the tag <b></b> are words bold but intstead you shuld be using the
  <strong></strong> tag because it conveys more informtion to the broswer
 it confers more meaning and it says this text has strong importance and
 therefore its displyed in bold rather than merely saying that this should
 styled so>-->
